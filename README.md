# TrustyAI Service

👋 The TrustyAI Service is intended to a hub for all kinds of Responsible AI workflows, such as
explainability, drift, and Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation. Designed as a REST server wrapping
a core Python library, the TrustyAI service is intended to be a tool that can operate in a local
environment, a Jupyter Notebook, or in Kubernetes.
